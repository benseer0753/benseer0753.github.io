<h1>Linux Software Management</h1>
<p>Software in Linux is organized in packages. These contain all of the files a
given program needs to run, and a list of other packages it depends on to run.
</p>

<p>These packages are managed by, you guessed it, a package manager. The one we
deal with most often is APT, the Advanced Package Tool. It comes pre-installed
on all Debian-based Linux distributions. This includes Ubuntu and Mint, the two
we use in CyberTitans.
</p>

<h2>What is APT?</h2>
<p>APT is the package manager we use on Ubuntu and Mint images. It is how we
install, update, and uninstall software. It is run from the command line, and
has a general syntax of:
</p>

<p><code><b>apt</b> <i>action package</i></code></p>

<p>Depending on what action you supply, you might not need a specific package
name.</p>

<h2>(Un)installation</h2>
<p>Installing and uninstalling packages with APT is simple. To install, it's
<code><b>sudo apt install</b> <i>package</i></code>, where <i>package</i> is
the name of the package.
</p>

<p>Take note, however, that the technical package name <i>is not</i> always the
same as the name displayed in the app list. Usually, it's similar, but you can
look up software to find its technical name.
</p>

<p>To uninstall, it's very similar. <code><b>sudo apt remove</b>
<i>package</i></code> will remove the specified package. Replacing <code>remove</code> with
<code>purge</code> will remove not just the package, but any packages it
depends on that no longer have a use.</p>

<p>Generally, <code>remove</code> works perfectly fine, and is a lot less risky
than <code>purge</code>. I recommend only using <code>purge</code> if you're
absolutely certain what you're doing. It can make quite a mess if misused.
</p>

<h2>Updating / Upgrading</h2>
<p>To update software (called upgrading in apt) you use two commands.</p>
<p>The first,</p>
<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>
<p>just updates the list of available packages from your default sources. This
makes sure your computer knows which versions of software are available so that
upgrades are not missed.</p>
<p>Then, after that has completed, run</p>
<p><code>sudo apt upgrade</code></p>
<p>This does the actual installation of the upgrades. It may take a while, so
it's a good option for doing during lunch.</p>

<h2>Common Malware</h2>
<p>The following is a list of common packages that we need to remove:</p>
<p class="notice">Remember: if the README says to keep it, we keep it. These
are just common ones to remove.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>wireshark</code></li>
  <li><code>aisleriot</code></li>
  <li><code>ophcrack</code></li>
  <li><code>apache2</code></li>
<ul>
