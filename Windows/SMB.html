<h1>SMB</h1>

<p>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security-hardening</p>

<h2>What is SMB?</h2>
<p>The Server Message Block protocol, often called SMB, is a protocol used to
share files, share printers, and communicate between processes. It is currently
developed by Microsoft, though Samba allows Linux computers to use it as well.
</p>

<h2>Disabling SMBv1</h2>

<p>Using SMB1, the earliest version of SMB, is very risky. It is best to disable
it and only use SMB2 or SMB3.</p>

<p>In order to do so, you can use the following powershell command:</p>
<p><code>Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol
</code></p>

<p class="notice">Take note that this will restart the computer, so make sure
you're not in the middle of anything else!
</p>

<h2>Managing Shares</h2>
<p>You can manage which shares are available on the network using Computer
Management (compmgmt.msc) or the File Share Manager (fsmgmt.msc). Both show the
same menu; the only difference is that Computer Management also shows user and
group management options.
</p>

<p>The shares "ADMIN$", "C$", and "IPC$" are enabled by default, and should not
be removed. I'm fairly certain they show back up when you restart the computer
anyways.
</p>

<p>Any shares with a '$' at the end are hidden from the default file explorer
view, and can only be managed through the MMC plugins mentioned earlier.
