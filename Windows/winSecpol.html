<h1>Local Security Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">For Windows and Windows Server</p>

<p><a href="quickSecpol.html">Quick Reference</a></p>

<p> Managing the local security policies on a system is very important. They control things ranging from password requirements to niche, technical security options.
Improperly configured security policies pose a risk to the security of the system that can easily be remedied.</p>

<p>To opening the Local Security Policy editor, type "secpol.msc" into the Run dialogue opened with WIN+r.</p>
<p>You can also edit them in the Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc), in the "Windows Settings" branch, under "Security Settings".</p>

<h2>Account Policies</h2>
<p> The policies in the Account Policies branch of secpol relate to password requirements and locking accounts after failed sign-ins.</p>
<h3>Password Policies</h3>
<p> Included here are the policies defining password requirements. In order, these are:

<ul>
<li>Enforce Password History</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 24</b><br>This is the number of previous passwords to save, in order to prevent users from rotating between a small number of passwords when asked to change them.</p>

<li>Maximum Password Age</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 90</b><br>This number, in days, is how long a user can keep the same password before being forced to change it.
These prevents old, potentially compromised passwords from remaining on the system.</p>

<li>Minimum Password Age</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 30</b><br>This number, in days, is how long after changing a password before a user can change it again.</p>

<li>Minimum Password Length</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 14</b><br>This is the minimum number of characters that a valid password can be. 14, for historical reasons, is the maximum on windows machines. It's also a good length for us.</p>

<li>Password Must Meet Complexity Requirements</li>
<p><b>Recommended: Enabled</b><br>Without this enabled, none of the other password requirements take effect. They're not much use to us unless they're turned on, so make sure to enable this.</p>

<li>Store Passwords Using Reversible Encryption</li>
<p><b>Recommended: Disabled</b><br>Windows already stores the passwords encrypted by default. This makes that encryption reversible, meaning that passwords can be learned just by finding them and unencrypting them.
Usually, they're stored using unreversible encryption, so enabling this is a security risk.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Account Lockout Policy</h3>
<p>These three policies dictate what should happen after consecutive failed login attempts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Account Lockout Duration</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 30</b><br>This number, in minutes, is how long the account should be locked out once enough failed logins occur.</p>

<li>Account Lockout Threshold</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 5</b><br>This is how many failed attempts are needed to trigger the account lockout. It shouldn't be too low, otherwise a series of honest typos could trigger it.
It also shouldn't be too high, or it'll give malicious actors more attempts to crack the password. 5 is a good middle-ground.</p>

<li>Reset Account Lockout Counter After</li>
<p><b>Recommended: 30</b><br>This is how many minutes it takes for the failed login attempt counter to reset.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Local Policies</h2>
<p>The Local Policies branch is much more varied, containing the Audit Policy, User Rights Assignment, and Security Options nodes.</p>
<h3>Audit Policy</h3>
<p>The Audit Policy is by far the simplest of the three. All you need to do is go into every option and check success and failure.</p>
<p>These options decide whether the computer keeps a log of administrative and other actions performed on it. How on earth you read them is beyond me, though.</p>

<h3>User Rights Assignment</h3>

<p>Here, we define what users are allowed to do and what rights they have.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller</li>
	<p><b>Recommended: No-one</b><br>
	This setting is only used by Credential Manager when backing up and restoring systems. No users should have this permission, as it could allow them to access other user's credentials.
	</p>
	
	<li>Access this compute from the network</li>
	<p><b>Recommended: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users</b><br>
	It's good to make sure only trusted users are allowed to access the computer remotely. This reduces the attack surface of the computer and gives fewer opportunities to malicious actors.
	</p>
	
	<li>Act as part of the operating system</li>
	<p><b>Recommended: No-one</b><br>
	Anyone with this right can completely control the computer and even erase any trace of their activities. It is incredibly hazardous to give to people, and should not be used.
	</p>
	
	<li>Adlust memory quotas for a process</li>
	<p><b>Recommended: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE,  NETWORK SERVICE</b><br>
	This permission allows a user to adjust how much memory is available to a process. This can by very useful for fine-tuning systems, but in the wrong hands could lead to denial-of-service.
	</p>
	
	<li>Allow log on locally</li>
	<p><b>Recommended: Administrators, Users</b><br>
	This controls who can login to the computer from the console. Illegitimate users, if given this permission, could login and use malware to elevate their privileges. 
	If legitimate users are not allowed to login, then the computer will be of little use to anybody.
	</p>
	
	<!-- From here forward, the rational blurbs are left blank for time -->
	<!-- I'll add them in later if I get the time to do it. It's just paraphrasing from the benchmark. -->
