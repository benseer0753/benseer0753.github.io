<h1>Firewall Setup</h1>
<p class="subtitle">For Windows and Windows Server</p>

<p>Usually, all you need to do for the firewall is turn it on. Sometimes, you'll need to go into the more advanced rules to make sure it's configured properly.</p>

<h2>Control Panel</h2>

<p>The first way to manage the firewall is through Control Panel. In icon view, click on the "Windows Defender Firewall" setting to open its menu. 
When in category view, click on "System and Security", then on "Windows Defender Firewall".</p>


<p> gpedit.msc goto Windows settings goto security settings goto Windows defender firewall etc. etc. manage it there by clicking the node</p>

<h2>Advanced Firewall Management with the Group Policy Editor</h2>

<p>Open the MMC, then File &gt; Add/Remove Snap-ins. Add in Windows Firewall with
Advaced Security.</p>
<p>Go to Windows Firewall Properties. You will see three tabs: Domain, Private,
and Public.</p>
<p>These are the three types of network in Windows. I'm not sure if these are
used much in modern windows.</p>
<p>Go into each tab and ensure the firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>Inbound connections should be blocked, outbound should be allowed.</p>
<p>Logging should be set to both Log dropped and Logged Successful Packets</p>
<p>Increase the Log size Limit to 6500</p>
