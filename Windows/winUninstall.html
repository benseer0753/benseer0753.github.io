<h1> Uninstalling Programs </h1>
<p> Often, there will be unwanted programs and applications on the images. Remember: never uninstall a program that is mentioned as required in the README.
You also should not uninstall: VMware tools [INCLUDE: the other shit].
</p>

<p> Also get rid of the %APPDATA% files</p>

<h2>Programs to Keep</h2>
<p>Always keep the following programs installed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CyberPatriot Scoring Engine</li>
	<li>Microsoft Visual C++</li>
	<li>Microsoft .Net Framework</li>
	<li>Vmware Tools</li>
</ul>

<h2> Control Panel </h2>

<p> The best place to uninstall unwanted programs is in Control Panel. To navigate to the Programs and Features page while in categories view, click on "Uninstall a program" below "Programs".
To navigate there from icons view, click on "Programs and Features".</p>
<p> From here, double-click on the app you want to uninstall, then click [YES] when prompted. Follow the instructions on any uninstaller that opens, making sure to remove as many associated files as possible.</p>
