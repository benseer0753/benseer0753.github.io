<h1>Roles and Features</h1>

<h2>What are Roles and Features?</h2>
<p>Roles define what type of server Windows computers are. This includes things
like HTML webservers, file share servers, or domain controllers managing other
computers on the network.
</p>

<p>Features are generally a bit smaller than roles. They work as little bonus
pieces of functionality for the computer. For example, BitLocker drive
encryption is a feature. It works in addition to any other roles and features
the computer has and doesn't completely change its function.
</p>

<p>Sometimes there will be roles and features installed on a computer that do
not need to be installed. These can present a security risk. The more
unnecessary features on a computer, the more likely it is that at least one will
have a security vulnerability.
</p>

<p>Besides being a security risk, extra roles and features running in the
background can slow down the computer. In a competition, this is annoying; in a
real work environment, this could lead to loss of productivity or past work.
</p>

<h2>Adding / Removing Roles and Features</h2>

<p>Adding and removing roles and features is slightly different between Server
and workstation Windows. On regular windows, you want to open "appwiz.cpl" in
the run dialogue or find it in control panel.
</p>

<p>On Windows Server, they can be managed in the Server Manager window. Click on
the "Manage" tab in the top-right, then on "Add/Remove Roles and Features". From
there, follow the prompts on-screen.
</p>

<h3>Roles to disable</h3>
<p>All of them. Unless <i>explicitly</i> stated in the README, it shouldn't be
there. Things like Telnet or FTP are common to see, and should always be
removed (unless specified) due to security flaws.
</p>

<h3>Features to Disable</h3>

<p class="notice">Remember: the README takes priority over all instructions
here. If the README says to keep it, you keep it.</p>
