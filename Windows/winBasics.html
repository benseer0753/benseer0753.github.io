<h2>The README</h2>
<p>The README is our main source of information and instruction during the competition.
It is broken up into several sections:</p>
<h3>First one</h3>
<h3>One that tells you which programs to have</h3>
<h3>Users and Administrators</h3>
<p>Here, we see a list of authorized users and administrators.
It is part of our job to ensure that these people, and only these people,
have access to the computer. See <a href="winUsers.html">here</a> for more
information on how to do that.
</p>

<h2>Forensics Questions</h2>
<p>We are also tasked with answering several forensics questions. These range
from asking about information about the system to decoding specific messages.
</p>
<p>It is important that these are answered, or at least read, before doing
anything else on the computer. It's is very possible to accidentally remove
files that you need for forensics questions while working.
</p>


<h2>User Management</h2>
<p>See <a href="winUsers.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Groups and Administrators</h2>

<h2>Shared Folders</h2>

<h2>Uninstalling Programs</h2>
<p>See <a href="winUninstall.html">here</a> for instructions</p>

<h2>Updating Software</h2>
<p>How this works will depend on the software. For browsers like Firefox or
Chrome, follow the on-screen prompts when you open a new window. you will
likely have to fully reinstall it from their website, so if it says updating
doesn't work, don't panic. Just click on the new link they provide you.</p>

<p>For most other software, you can usually check the installed version by
using the "About" option in the menu bar. If it's lower than the latest version
on their website (or the version listed in the README) download updates from
their website.</p>


<h2>Windows Defender Firewall</h2>
<p>In Control Panel, open the Windows Defender Firewall (WDF) page. You can do
this quickly by searching "firewall" in the top-right. Once there, click on
"Turn firewall on or off" on the left. Enable outgoing, disable incoming and
hit "OK" or "Apply".


<h2>Windows Security</h2>
<p>Windows Security, formerly known as Windows Defender or Windows Defender Antivirus, is the bult-in antimalware tool in windows.
</p>
<h3>Virus &amp; Threat Protection</h3>
<p>In the Virus &amp; threat protection menu, we have the settings related to Windows Security's computer scan.
We will want to click on "Manage settings" at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Here, we can enable real-time protection. This ensures that the computer is scanning files for potential malware when installing or running software.</p>
<p>Controlled folder access?</p>
<p>Under exlusions, in the add or remove exclusions menu, we want to remove all exclusions except for "C:\CyberPatriot\". 
Removing this exclusion will likely get it flagged by the scan, breaking the image.
</p>

<h2>Security Policies</h2>
<p>See <a href="winSecpol.html">here</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Misc. Control Panel</h2>
<h3>Autoplay</h3>
<p>As simple as searching it up and unchecking boxes</p>

<h3>Remote Assistance</h3>
<p>Search "Assist" in the search bar, and it should be the top result. Uncheck
the box allowing it, and check if the README wants you to turn off Remote
Desktop Protocol too.
</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>See <a href="services.html">here</a> for some more details.</p>

<h2>Update Windows</h2>
<p>This will take a while, and it will slow down the computer the whole time.
Don't do it right at the start, but don't wait too long either. I recommend
letting these run as you eat lunch, or something similar.
</p>
<p>Just look up "Windows Update" in the search bar, and it'll pop right up.
