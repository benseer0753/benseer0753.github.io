<p>https://www.baeldung.com/linux/password-complexity, https://askubuntu.com/questions/156850/how-do-you-set-requirements-such-as-minimum-length-on-passwords, https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec5</p>
<p><i>Could we set up pam files on a USB stick, then just copy them in? At the least we could use them as reference. We'd just need one from a fully-cleared practice image.</i></p>
<p>editing /etc/pam.d/common-password</p>
<p>minlen=10 <- this is generally enough, I think. It's what I usually use on windows. if you don't get points, check you did it right then set it higher.</p> 
<p>retry=5 <- I think this is good, if it works like windows password limits. Too few means you get locked out for a typo, too many doesn't stop malactors in time</p>
<p>auth   required   pam_tally2.so deny=5 unlock_time=3600 even_deny_root <- this locks you out of the account if you mess up 5 times.</p>
<p>PASS_MAX_DAYS should be 90, I think? Set it to the same as whatever windows has as default.</p>
<p>PASS_MIN_DAYS should be 30, that's what they like it set to</p>
<p>PASS_MIN_LEN also like 10-ish? I think these caps ones are for new account creation.</p>
