<h1> Useful Powershell Commands </h1>
<p> Powershell has the potential to be a very powerful tool in the arsenal of a skilled CyberTitan.
With practice, it can streamline processes that usually require navigating convoluted menus and make them as easy as typing a few commands.
</p>

<h2 id="search"> Searching for a File </h2>

<p> Using powershell, we can search for files a lot more quickly and smoothly than by using Explorer. This is often useful for forensics questions, and allows you to do other work while it searches.
</p>
<p> The following code searches for a file called "example.html" in the Users directory and all of its subdirectories.
You can change the directory to just "C:\" in order to search the entire filesystem. You can also use wildcards in the filename. For more on wildcards, see
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_wildcards?view=powershell-7.5">here</a>.
