<h1>User Management</h1>
<p class="subtitle">For Windows and Windows Server</p>
<h2>Control Panel</h2>

<p> Using Control panel to manage users is one of the simplest ways to manage users, and is what I recommend for beginners. The UI [GLOS] provided makes it simple to tell, at a glance, the type and password status of users.
Unfortunately, it lacks any way to manage user groups. This makes it only suitable for less complex management tasks.
</p>
<h3>Adding / Removing Users, Changing Passwords, and Giving / Revoking Admin Status</h3>
<p> Adding and removing users in Control panel is a quick and easy 3-step process.
</p>
<h4>1. Open Control Panel</h4>
<p> You can open Control Panel in one of 3 ways. The simplest is to search for it in the start menu, and click on its icon when it appears. <br>
The second is to either right-click on the start icon or hit WIN-x to open the Power User menu. From there, simply click on the Control Panel option. <br>
The third is to open the Run dialogue with WIN-r, typing in "Control Panel", and hitting enter.

<h4>2. Navigating to the User Management Menu</h4>
<p> From the main Control Panel menu, when sorted into the default categories (see fig. n): Click on the "User Accounts" option, then again on "User Accounts" on the next screen. From there, click on "Manage another account".</p>
<p> When the main Control Panel menu is sorted into icons (see fig. n+1): Click on "User Accounts" once (the icons are alphabetical, so it'll be near the bottom), then click on "Manage another account".
</p>

<h4>3. The Actual Management</h4>
<p> From here, click on the name or icon of the user you want to manage, then click on [REPHRASE: the option you want to do]. From there, follow the on-screen instructions.
<p> [INCLUDE: Maybe more details about the options?]</p>

<h2> Computer Management </h2>
<p> Using Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) is my preferred way to manage users. It provides a GUI [GLOSS] where you can conveniently manage many parts of your computer.</p>

<h3> Adding / Removing Users</h3>
<p> go to Local Users and Groups</p>
<p> Double cick on user, go to "Member Of" to manage group membership</p>
<p> right clikc on name for delete and set password</p>
<p> double click on group to manage users</p>

<h2> Powershell </h2>
<p> A quick, direct way to manage users is through the <code>net</code> command. This gives you a text-based way to manage users, usergroups, and many other aspects of your system.</p>
<p> To manage a user through <code>net</code>, type <code>net user username</code>, followed by the action you want to perform and any arguments it takes.</p>

<h3> Adding / Removing Users </h3>

<p><i>Note: All powershell commands are by default case-insensitive [GLOSS]. This includes usernames and domains, but <b>not</b> passwords. Keep that in mind when managing accounts.</i></p>
<p> to add a user with net is simple. Run the command <code>net user username /ADD</code>. A password can also be specified at account creation with <code>net user username password /ADD</code>.
If, instead of a password, a '*' is typed, then a password prompt will be displayed so the password can be typed without revealing it to any onlookers. I recommend typing it directly during competition so that you can verify its spelling.</p>
<p> Removing users uses the same syntax, just replacing <code>/ADD</code> with <code>/DELETE</code> and without the password parameter.</p>

<h3> Managing User Type </h3>

<p><i>For more details on managing localgroups, see here</i></p>
<p> Managing user types through <code>net</code> is done through the <code>net localgroup</code> command. This is because "Administrators" are simply a group of users with all of their permissions turned on. To add a user to Administrators, type <code>net localgroup Administrators /add username</code>.
To remove a user, type <code>net localgroup Administrators /delete username</code>. To see a list of current Administrators, type <code>net localgroup Administrators</code>.</p>
